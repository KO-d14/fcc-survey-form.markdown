<h4> Acknowledgment: </h4> 
  Thank you to those who answered my questions and given me feedbacks on the <i>FCC forum. </i>
  
<h4> Project Status: </h4>
  So far content with how the project looks, so it will be considered as "finished." <br>
  Just would like feedbacks on my work: if I'm not implementing proper coding practices, if there are better ways to code it, etc. :)

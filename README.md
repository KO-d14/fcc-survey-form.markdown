Acknowledgment: 
  Thank you to those who answered my questions and given me feedbacks on the FCC forum. 
  
Project Status: 
  So far content with how the project looks, so it will be considered as "finished." 
  Just would like feedbacks on my work: if I'm not implementing proper coding practices, if there are better ways to code it, etc. :)
